# Spam Filtering System with NLP

## Project Overview
This project implements an automated system to filter spam SMS and emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between spam and legitimate messages.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Naive Bayes classification model
- Real-time spam prediction with confidence scores
- Web-based user interface with Streamlit
- Model training and evaluation capabilities
