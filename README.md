📧 SMS Spam Detection using NLP & Machine Learning

This project is a Spam Detection System built with Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning.
It classifies text messages as Spam or Not Spam, helping filter unwanted SMS.

🚀 Features

📌 Preprocessing of text (stopwords removal, stemming, lowercasing).

📌 Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

📌 Model training with Naive Bayes Classifier.

📌 Simple and interactive Streamlit web app for predictions.

📌 Easy-to-run project for beginners in NLP/ML.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

NLTK (Natural Language Processing)

Streamlit (Web App)

⚡ Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/Spam-Detection-NLP.git
cd Spam-Detection-NLP


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the app:

streamlit run main.py


Open in browser → http://localhost:8501

🎯 Output

✅ User enters a message

✅ App predicts whether it is Spam or Not Spam

📌 Future Improvements

Add more ML models (SVM, Random Forest).

Use deep learning (LSTM, Transformers).

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud for live demo.
